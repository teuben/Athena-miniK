# Athena-miniK

Greatly simplified version of the compute kernal in AthenaK, designed for use
with pyThena.  Only implements algorithms for Newtonian and special relativistic hydro
and MHD on a Cartesian grid with AMR.

Athena-miniK relies on the Kokkos library for performance portability.  This allows
it to be run on almost any architecture.
